## 👋 Hi, I’m Doyoung Kim – an aspiring NLP/MLOps engineer passionate about building real-world AI systems across language, vision, and automation. 

🧠 Recent Projects
• SoundBank – AI-based fund recommendation system (TensorFlow + FastAPI + AWS + React)  
• Lingo – multilingual search and translation API for multicultural users  
• Multilingual AI ERP Platform(On Progress) – my personal project integrating ASR (Whisper), OCR (Tesseract), NMT (MarianMT), and multimodal alignment for global English learning and career support

🔍 Core Interests
• Multimodal pipelines combining speech, vision, and language  
• MLOps for scalable deployment of LLM-based services  
• Human-in-the-loop NLP tools and post-editing workflows

📚 I also led a small paper reading group focused on retrieval-augmented generation and tool-augmented language agents, to better understand how LLMs can interact with knowledge and environments.

🚀 Currently applying to the DLI Lab @ Yonsei University, hoping to contribute to NLP research that meets real-world complexity and scale.
